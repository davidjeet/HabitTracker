# Using basic SV-modifier 

1. Create new habit in svm form.
2. Log habit.
3. Edit Habit/Delete Habit in grid.


* Habit list for the day in grid (editable rows for today only)
* Can go back or forward and browse previous days.
* Later, need analytics screens.
 * Do not break existing Agile Results, but rather clone repo (or at least copy the content and create a new repo to practice build/deploy)
